      <span class="emph2">Objects</span> need not have a one-to-one relationship with web pages.  In other words, a single web page can contain many objects (just as a book of poetry contains many poems).

      The sharing of semantic metadata about these objects makes it possible for <%= Setup.site_name() %> users to explore <%= time_period %> online scholarship along many dimensions, as well as to
