Collex Setup
============
Collex is a combination of a rails app and two WordPress sites. The WorddPress 
isites are embedded into Collex and are used for displaying the news and about pages. 

Collex
------
After checking out a copy of Collex, follow the installation instructions found 
in the README file.

Collex has 3 (so far) federations. Each is a separate deploy of collex that is 
skinned to look a certain way. The deply script has commands to deploy each of
the federations; nines, 18th connect and mesa. Be sure to deploy them all.

WordPress
---------
Install 2 copies of WordPress per collex federation. The general naming scheme for
these installations is: wp_[federation]_news and wp_[federation]_about. 

Create symlinks to the WordPress news and about installations for each installation
in that installations public folder. The links are named 'news' and 'about'.

The databases for each follow a similar convention: [federation]_wp.

The virtual host config for each federation must be updated to disable passenger
on these WordPress instalations. Add the following to that file:

    <Directory "/full/path/to/about/wp_install">
        PassengerEnabled off
        AllowOverride all
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/full/path/to/news/wp_install">
        PassengerEnabled off
        AllowOverride all
    </Directory>

The theme used for WordPress is extracted from the css found in each Collex
installation. To make this happen, two WordPress themes must be installed
for each WordPress site.

Navigate to the WordPress administration panel. Choose Appearance and Install Themes.
Install the Hybrid theme (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/hybrid) and 
the Rails Theme (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rails-theme/)

After plugins are installed, navigate to the Rails plugin settings.
Set the base URL to match the installed site.
Set Body class to something like this: federation-[FEDERATION] pg-[about or news] pg-lvl2

Other WP settings:
Reading - set front page to static
Discussion - turn off all default article settings (no discussions)
Permalinks - use the 'Post name' setting
