# This relates folder names to archive names in this set of rdf files.
# When adding a new archive, also add a line here that says what top level
# folder that archive is in.
# The format is <sp><sp>"archive_name":<sp>["arc_rdf_foldername",pageSize, 1000]
# Use double-quotes around each item. Do not use tabs -- that will break the file.
#
# The pageSize is used to give the indexer a clue about how much text is with an archive.
# When adding an entry just pick a number that is used for a similar archive, then after
# one run, the log file will contain enough info to change it to a more accurate number.
#
# These are listed in the order they will be processed, so I've put the more difficult ones at
# the end so the easy ones will get indexed quickly.
#
# The batches just make it easier to run, since it takes so long to do the entire index.
